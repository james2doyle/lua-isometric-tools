### Tests

Tests use [lester](https://edubart.github.io/lester/) to do all the assertions.

Run a test suite:

```sh
lua tests/map_tests.lua --stop-on-fail
```

Run a single test matching a filter:

```sh
lua tests/tilemap_tests.lua --filter="events"
```

Running all tests:

```sh
find tests/ -name '*.lua' -exec lua {} \;
```
